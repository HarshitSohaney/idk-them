For the times when you can't really tell if you know an artist or not. IDK Them acts as a "better" library search for your music library (currently just spotify) where it'll tell you if you have an artist in your library or not, and at what capacity.

Currently accessible at [idk-them.vercel.app](https://idk-them.vercel.app)
